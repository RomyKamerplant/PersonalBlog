### My reasons to create a website

Setting up a website all on your own is not easy in the beginning. It requires hard work and discipline. You need to learn about many new frameworks and programming languages and it can be really frustrating. But I think that it is still worth it. Here are my biggest reasons why you should create your personal website:

#### 1. Learn about web development

During the process you learn a lot about different frameworks and programming languages. However, you not only learn about pure programming skills but also you boost your creativity and you get to know many interesting background stories. This is really cool as it opens a door for lots of different projects for you. As your next step you could start an E-Commerce website, create a little video game or become a freelancer. So learning web development is a good idea for your career and offers you many financial oportunities.
Besides, it is also quite fun - after many frustrating hours of dealing with stupid errors of course.

#### 2. Train yourself in self reflection

A web blog where you post stuff from your personal life makes you self reflect on the things you experienced. I think this is a very important aspect as your personality grows with it and you may learn from your mistakes. Self reflection may also help you deal with stress and better control your emotions. 

#### 3. Get in contact with other people

A truly interactive website where everybody is invited to contribute and exchange thoughts and experiences with each other is a win for everybody. You can get inspired by the blogposts from other people or share your thoughts and discuss a topic with others. Your website could be a little social media replacement - where you do not have to be afraid about data privacy and profit thinking.

4. ##### Get educated

Either via researching information about a topic for your blogpost or reading the blogpost of another person, a blogwebsite is always a source of inspiration and knowledge. A lot of stuff may be really helpful in your life like learning how to make a delicious recipe, learn about a scientific discovery or fitness tips.

### What the future holds for my personal website

On this Blogwebsite I will regularly post stuff related to science and technology. As my expertise is more in the medical sciences I will probably post topics from these fields. However, there will also be posts about technology, environment, software etc. 
Additionally, I would like to add more and more features into this website. I would like that everyone can write a blogpost here and that there is a blogpost forum organised into different topics. In the moment the website is in English but I hope that I can add German/Spanish/French/etc. translations soon. In this way even more people will be able to interact and the experience will be much nicer. 
Furthermore, I want to learn more about styling a website. There are so many options such as animations, curves, icons etc. 
While the first version of my website focuses on the functionality of my blogposts I will soon want to add a database so that you can comment and add your own blogposts. 
Next to this website, I will also be working on other software projects. On top of my coding projects is to make a machine learning program. I will also share all my progress here on this website. If you have any suggestions on how this website could be improved feel free to send me a message!
