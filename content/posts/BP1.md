## My reasons to create a website

Setting up a website using JS frameworks all on your own is not easy. It requires hard work and discipline. WHile you could be watching movies or playing video games or going to a party you are there in front of your PC and crying because of some stupid coding errors. But I think that it is still worth it. You learn a lot about not only web development but also about creativity, self reflection, habit creation and writing skills. This is the first reason I made this website. Learning! Ever since the end of my bachelor - that is in 2019 - I wanted to learn how to program stuff. Be it a website, a robot, a video game or a mobile app. I wanted to learn it all. However, I never had the time and the patience to really create something unique. I followed tutorials and copy and pasted 90% of the code and felt super proud when a program worked. But at some point I wanted to really start fresh and get everything right. You can see the results of my learning now on this website. And I can already tell that I learned a lot in the making of this website.
Another reason for this website is that it serves as your personal adress in the world wide web. I distrust social media such as Instagram, Facebook & Co. and by setting up this website I want to get in contact with all you out there without giving away all our data. I really want my website do my active and especially interactive. I think that exchanging knowledge and experiences is very helpful and important. Finally, a personal website looks good on a resume. Not only when you are a software engineer but also anywhere else. It shows that you have variable skills and that you try to connect yourself and that you are a digital native.

## What the future holds for my personal website

On this Blogwebsite I will regularly post stuff related to science and technology. As my expertise is more in the medical sciences I will probably post topics from these fields. However, there will also be posts about technology, environment, software etc. 
Additionally, I would like to add more and more features into this app. I would like that everyone can write a blogpost here and that there is a blogpost forum divided into different topics. In the moment the website is in English but I hope that I can add German/Spanish/French/etc. translations soon. In this way even more people will be able to interact and the experience will be much nicer. 
Furthermore, I want to learn more about styling a website. There are so many options such as animations, curves, icons etc. 
While the first version of my website will focus on functionality I will soon try to make this website beautiful. 
Next to this website, I will also be working on other software projects. On top of my coding projects is to make a machine learning program. I will also share all my progress here on this website. If you have any suggestions on how this website could be improved feel free to send me a message!

## How I created the website

This website is created using the Javascript Framework Vue.JS. This framework has a lot of features which make it very easy for beginners to create websites. Then I also used Nuxt.JS, a framework for VUE.JS, so a framework for a framework. Nuxt.JS has some additional features for VUE such as Server Site Rendering or automatic component integration which makes coding even easier. 
For the styling I used Tailwind CSS and  another VUE framework called VUESAX which offers preconfigured components such as the navigation bar. I think that VUE.JS is a really handy framework for beginners. I can really recommend you to try out setting up a website yourself using these app and frameworks. When it comes to proramming the most important thing is to be patient. You should not jump right away into creating a project but take your time reading and viewing tutorials. 
I hope you liked my first blogpost. See you in the next one!
