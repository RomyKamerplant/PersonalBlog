I would like that everyone can write a blogpost here and that there is a blogpost forum organised into different topics. In the moment the website is in English but I hope that I can add German\u002FSpanish\u002FFrench\u002Fetc. translations soon. In this way even more people will be able to interact and the experience will be much nicer.\nFurthermore, I want to learn more about styling a website. There are so many options such as animations, curves, icons etc.\nWhile the first version of my website focuses on the functionality of my blogposts I will soon want to add a database so that you can comment and add your own blogposts.\nNext to this website, I will also be working on other software projects. On top of my coding projects is to make a machine learning program. I will also share all my progress here on this website. If you have any suggestions on how this website could be improved feel free to send me a message!"}]}]},dir:"\u002Fposts",path:"\u002Fposts\u002Fwhatyoucanexpect",extension:".md",updatedAt:"2022-02-24T20:59:51.475Z"}}],fetch:{},mutations:[]}}("text","element","\n","a","true",-1,"span","icon","icon-link","p","h4","my-reasons-to-create-a-website",3,"My reasons to create a website","what-the-future-holds-for-my-personal-website","What the future holds for my personal website","h3")));
